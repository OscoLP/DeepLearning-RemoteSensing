# DeepLearning-RemoteSensing
Here we intent do publish easy-to-implement deep neural network codes. These codes are prepared to deal mostly with remote sensing data. Remote sensing data include, but are not limited to, spectral and image data. The examples prepared here are only for educational purposes. If you are in need of anything else or have an issue to report, please feel free to.
