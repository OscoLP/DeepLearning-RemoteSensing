# DeepLearning-RemoteSensing
Here, we intend to publish easy-to-implement deep neural network codes. These codes are prepared to deal mostly with remote sensing data. Remote sensing data include, but are not limited to, spectral and image information. The examples prepared here are only for educational purposes. If you require anything else or have an issue to report, please feel free to.

## Machine and Deep Learning Applied in Remote Sensing Data

Machine learning (ML) and deep neural networks (DNN) are currently being used in a series of applications. In the remote sensing field domain, this type of analysis has been explored in several issues, being it both in spectral, image, photogrammetry, among others, subfields. One of the most important characteristics of the machine and deep learning algorithms in remote sensing data is its capability of dealing with different types of examples, achieving impressive performances, and being useful in generalization approaches.

Up to this time, the following codes are available for educational purposes.

## Machine Learning Example (ML_Example.ipynb)

This code is written to be applied in one-dimensional datasets, with both binary and multilabel characteristics. The example uses a binary type of classification, however, with few modifications it can be adapted to multilabel. The primary idea here is to investigate the performance of traditional shallow learners from the sklearn library. With this code, it is possible to use a spectral type of data measured with proximal sensors.
