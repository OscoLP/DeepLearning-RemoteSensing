# DeepLearning-RemoteSensing
Here, we intend to publish easy-to-implement deep neural network codes. These codes are prepared to deal mostly with remote sensing data. Remote sensing data include, but are not limited to, spectral and image information. The examples prepared here are only for educational purposes. If you require anything else or have an issue to report, please feel free to.

###### Disclaimer: This repository is currently under construction and will only be fully-available once a publication of its content is released. Until there, expect constant modifications.
